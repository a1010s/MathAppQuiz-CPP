# MathQuizAPI

## Overview
CppMathQuizAPI is a simple web application that serves a math quiz through a C++ backend server using `cpp-httplib` and a frontend interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The backend provides an API to fetch quiz questions and submit answers, while the frontend allows users to interact with the quiz.

## Features
- Backend server written in C++ using `cpp-httplib` for handling HTTP requests.
- Frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a simple and interactive user experience.
- Dockerized setup for both backend and frontend for easy deployment.

## Inspiration
I was inspired by the Lexibook kids laptop to create this app for my son, who is passionate about math and wanted a more beautiful design than the inspiring app.
